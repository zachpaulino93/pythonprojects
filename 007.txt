Called them to look for a second-hand RAV4 and they are nvery nice and patience
to help me find a few matches the scheduled an appointment with me. Come in and
they had everything ready for me. i was surprised how professional those sales
are and they explained and answered all my questions. Ended up buyting the car
and been using it for more than a month now. Everything looks good!
